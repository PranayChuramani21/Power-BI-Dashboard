### Dashboard Charts

**Doughnut Charts :** Doughnut charts are similar to pie charts. They describe the relationship of parts to a whole. The only differentiating factor is that the center is blank that allows space for a label or icon.

**Line Charts :** Line charts emphasize the overall shape of an entire series of values.

**Matrix :** It is used to display data meaningfully across multiple dimensions.

**Slicer :** A slicer is a standalone chart that can be used to filter the other visuals on the page.

**Bar Charts :** Bar charts are the standard charts for visualizing a specific value across different categories.
